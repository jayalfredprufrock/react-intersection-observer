Example a target within a scrollable frame and iframes to behave correctly. Note that in the example we're using `Window` as the root, which indicates that the observed target triggers changes when intersecting with the viewport, in this case `Window`.

To see another approach to setting the `root`, check out the [rootMargin](https://researchgate.github.io/react-intersection-observer/?selectedKind=Examples&selectedStory=Margin) example.
